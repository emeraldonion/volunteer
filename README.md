# Volunteer as an Advisory Board Member

Emerald Onion is a U.S. 501(c)(3) human rights nonprofit and transit ISP supporting internet privacy infrastructure since 2017. We are 100% volunteer-run and 100% donation based. Below is a list of voluntary roles and responsibilities that we need help with to grow. Do you have the time and passion to donate to help empower millions around the world? We’re interested in folks who have different levels of experience.

## Legal & Policy

Emerald Onion would appreciate having more legal and tech policy folks around. We think there’s a lot that can be done in this space, not to mention helping with the occasional subpoenas for non-existent user data.

## Finance

As a developing 501(c)(3), we have specific responsibilities managing donations and filings. This is a manageable task for our existing admins, but we’d love to bring someone on board who’s passionate about internet privacy while also looking for professional experiences in nonprofit finance. One task that we’d love help with is publishing our donation amounts and categorical expenses on an annual basis since launching in 2017.

## Human Resources

Even though Emerald Onion is 100% volunteer run, we don’t have any kind of HR-style compliance policies or procedures. We’re hoping to find someone interested in helping us mature in this area.

## Technology

We want to make the internet more anonymous (privacy), safer for everyone not just the privileged (encryption), more accessible (anti-censorship), and we want to do more. What we're currently doing:

- BGP for AS 396507 (1x /36 v6, 4x /24 v4)
- Tor exit relays and bridge relays @ https://emeraldonion.org/bridges
- DNS (https://github.com/emeraldonion/DNS) @ dns.disobey.net
- Distributed cryptographic randomness as a service (https://www.drand.love)
- Censorship detection
- IPFS Supernode
- Fediverse/Mastodon @ disobey.net
- XMTP node @ xmtp.disobey.net

If you're passionate about any of this stuff, we'd love some more help. But we want to do other cool stuff, so what things don't we do that you could help us with?

# What do we expect of you?

Emerald Onion Advisory Board Members are from all around the world, have interesting backgrounds, and we hang out in end-to-end encrypted messenger Signal where we talk about our work. We expect volunteers to join us in these spaces, advise on direction, help with new or existing projects, all on your time. Because all of us are volunteers, none of us expect too much from any other as far as time commitments. If you want to run with your own project, you’re welcome to spend as much time on it as you would like and we’ll do our best to help.

You should expect to be welcomed and empowered. We are all students and teachers with every interaction. Like the Tor network, we are more powerful with our diversity. We encourage women, black, PoC, immigrants, non-binary, LatinX, LGBTQIA+, and everyone in between to apply.

# Apply

Please email a statement of interest and CV to `volunteer` at `emeraldonion.org`. Tell us about the kind of internet that you want, and how you're going to help Emerald Onion help get everyone else there.
